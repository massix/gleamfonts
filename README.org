* Gleamfonts
Simple command line tool to easily fetch and install [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/][Nerdfonts]] in a [[https://termux.dev/en/][Termux]]
environment.

The tool is written using the [[https://gleam.run/][Gleam programming language]] and needs a working
[[https://www.erlang.org/][Erlang]] VM to be used locally.

** Install from source
You can manually install gleamfonts into your system by following the steps
below.

1. Clone the repository locally, somewhere in your home folder in Termux:
   #+begin_src bash
   mkdir -p ~/dev
   cd ~/dev
   git clone https://github.com/massix/gleamfonts.git
   cd gleamfonts
   #+end_src
2. Install Erlang, Gleam and SQLite using the official package manager:
   #+begin_src bash
   pkg update && pkg install -y erlang gleam libsqlite
   #+end_src
3. Compile the project
   #+begin_src bash
   make clean install
   #+end_src
   This step will install the binary distribution inside the
   ~/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/opt/gleamfonts~ folder, along with a
   convenient [[./scripts/gleamfonts][script]] to make it easier to launch the application without
   knowing all the details of how to launch an Erlang application.  The
   script will be installed inside ~/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin~,
   making it available in your PATH.

To verify that the installation is successful, reload your environment (or
restart the Termux application) and launch ~gleamfonts --help~, you should
be greeted with the help page of the application.

** How it works
The first time the program is run, it will fetch all the needed information
from the GitHub's releases page of the [[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts][official repository]], presenting the
user with a wide variety of choices regarding which specific release to use
and which asset (font) to download.  Once the user has made their choice,
Gleamfonts will download the corresponding ZIP file and ask the user which
specific variant of the font to install (this is due to the fact that Termux
does not support multiple variants, only a single ttf file can be installed).

Gleamfonts will then extract *that* variant of the chosen font into a
temporary folder and ask the user if they trust Gleamfonts enough to replace
the default Termux font with the newly downloaded one.  Should the user
refuse, Gleamfonts will exit right after printing the local path where the
file can be found.

* Contributions
All contributions are of course welcome, this is a hobby project and I think
it is simple enough to be used a starting point for learning Gleam.  There are
quite some unit tests which should cover most of the codebase.
